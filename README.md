# MIPS-Lite-Simulator
MIPS architecture is mainly designed to demonstrate core RISC principles. It features a small, efficient instruction set with uniform formats (R, I, J types) and a register-based design. Ideal for teaching and research, MIPS-Lite supports a 5-stage pipeline, enabling learners to explore pipelining, hazards, and performance analysis.
