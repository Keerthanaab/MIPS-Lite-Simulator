This project involves the design and development of a simulator for the MIPS-lite Instruction Set Architecture (ISA). The simulator is built to provide both functional and timing analysis of instruction execution, offering insights into machine behavior and performance on a 5-stage pipeline.

Key features of the simulator include:

Functional Simulation: Simulates the execution of MIPS-lite instructions, tracking changes in the machine state, such as register values and memory contents.
Timing Simulation: Models the timing characteristics of a 5-stage pipeline, providing detailed insights into instruction execution cycles.
The simulator generates the following outputs:

A comprehensive breakdown of instruction frequencies in the trace, categorized by instruction type.
The final machine state after completing the instruction trace, including all updated register values and memory contents.
The total execution time, measured in clock cycles, required for processing the instruction trace on the pipeline.
This simulator is a valuable tool for understanding and analyzing the behavior and performance of pipelined processors.
